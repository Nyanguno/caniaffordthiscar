            <h1>Complete Car Buying Guide</h1>
            <p>Everything you need to know about buying a car you can actually afford</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="content-card">
            <h2>Step 1: Determine Your Car Budget</h2>
            
            <p>Before you even start looking at cars, you need to establish a realistic budget. This is the most crucial step that many buyers skip, leading to financial stress later.</p>
            
            <h3>The 20/4/10 Rule</h3>
            <p>Financial experts recommend the 20/4/10 rule as a conservative approach to car buying:</p>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>20/4/10 Rule Breakdown</h4>
                <p><strong>20%</strong> - Put down at least 20% as a down payment<br>
                <strong>4</strong> - Finance for no more than 4 years<br>
                <strong>10%</strong> - Keep total vehicle expenses under 10% of gross monthly income</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>This rule helps ensure you don't become "upside down" on your loan (owing more than the car is worth) and keeps your transportation costs manageable.</p>
            
            <h3>Calculate Your Total Transportation Budget</h3>
            <p>Your car payment is just one part of your total transportation costs. You also need to budget for:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Insurance:</strong> $100-300+ per month depending on coverage and location</li>
                <li><strong>Fuel:</strong> $100-200+ per month based on driving habits and fuel efficiency</li>
                <li><strong>Maintenance:</strong> $100-150 per month for routine maintenance and repairs</li>
                <li><strong>Registration and taxes:</strong> Varies by state and vehicle value</li>
                <li><strong>Parking:</strong> If applicable in your area</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>These additional costs can easily add $300-500 or more to your monthly transportation budget, so factor them in when determining how much you can afford for a car payment.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="content-card">
            <h2>Step 2: New vs. Used Car Decision</h2>
            
            <p>One of the biggest decisions you'll make is whether to buy new or used. Each option has distinct advantages and disadvantages that can significantly impact your finances.</p>

                <li>Want the latest safety and technology features</li>
                <li>Prefer the peace of mind that comes with a full warranty</li>
                <li>Can afford the higher monthly payments without straining your budget</li>
                <li>Qualify for manufacturer incentives or special financing deals</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>When to Buy Used</h3>
            <p>Consider buying used if you:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Want to maximize your purchasing power</li>
                <li>Are comfortable with potentially higher maintenance costs</li>
                <li>Don't need the latest features</li>
                <li>Want to avoid the steepest depreciation</li>
                <li>Are buying your first car or have a limited budget</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="warning-box">
                <h4>Sweet Spot for Used Cars</h4>
                <p>Many experts recommend cars that are 2-4 years old with 20,000-60,000 miles. These vehicles have absorbed the steepest depreciation but still have modern features and potentially some warranty coverage remaining.</p>

            <h2>Step 3: Financing Your Car Purchase</h2>
            
            <p>Understanding your financing options can save you thousands of dollars over the life of your loan. Don't just accept the first financing offer you receive.</p>
            
            <h3>Financing Options</h3>
            
            <h4>1. Bank or Credit Union Loans</h4>
            <p>Often offer the best interest rates, especially if you have good credit. Get pre-approved before shopping to know your budget and have negotiating power.</p>
            
            <h4>2. Dealer Financing</h4>
            <p>Convenient but may not offer the best rates. Dealers sometimes mark up the interest rate to make a profit. Always compare with your pre-approved rate.</p>
            
            <h4>3. Manufacturer Financing</h4>
            <p>Car manufacturers sometimes offer special financing deals, especially on new cars. These can include 0% APR for qualified buyers, but may require excellent credit.</p>
            
            <h3>Factors Affecting Your Interest Rate</h3>
            
            <table class="comparison-table">

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>Improve Your Credit Before Buying</h4>
                <p>If your credit score is below 700, consider waiting a few months to improve it. Paying down credit card balances and ensuring all bills are paid on time can quickly boost your score and save you thousands in interest.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Loan Term Considerations</h3>
            <p>While longer loan terms mean lower monthly payments, they also mean:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>More total interest paid over the life of the loan</li>
                <li>Higher risk of being "upside down" on the loan</li>
                <li>Potential for the car to need major repairs while still making payments</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Stick to 48 months or less if possible, and never go beyond 60 months unless absolutely necessary.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="content-card">
            <h2>Step 4: Research and Shopping</h2>
            
            <p>Knowledge is power when car shopping. The more you know about the car you want and its market value, the better deal you can negotiate.</p>
            
            <h3>Research Tools</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Kelley Blue Book (KBB):</strong> Vehicle values and reviews</li>
                <li><strong>Edmunds:</strong> True market value and dealer incentives</li>
                <li><strong>Consumer Reports:</strong> Reliability ratings and owner satisfaction</li>
                <li><strong>IIHS and NHTSA:</strong> Safety ratings and crash test results</li>
                <li><strong>Manufacturer websites:</strong> Official specs, features, and incentives</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>What to Research</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Reliability ratings:</strong> How likely is the car to need repairs?</li>
                <li><strong>Resale value:</strong> How well does the car hold its value?</li>
                <li><strong>Fuel economy:</strong> EPA ratings for city and highway driving</li>
                <li><strong>Safety ratings:</strong> IIHS Top Safety Pick awards and NHTSA star ratings</li>
                <li><strong>Owner reviews:</strong> Real-world experiences from current owners</li>
                <li><strong>Common problems:</strong> Known issues for the specific model year</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>For Used Cars: Additional Research</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Vehicle history report:</strong> Carfax or AutoCheck for accident history</li>
                <li><strong>Maintenance records:</strong> Evidence of regular maintenance</li>
                <li><strong>Recall information:</strong> Check if recalls have been addressed</li>
                <li><strong>Market pricing:</strong> Compare similar vehicles in your area</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="warning-box">
                <h4>Red Flags for Used Cars</h4>
                <p>Avoid cars with: flood damage, multiple previous owners, accident history, missing maintenance records, or prices significantly below market value (often indicates hidden problems).</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="content-card">
            <h2>Step 5: Negotiation Strategies</h2>
            
            <p>Negotiating a car purchase can save you thousands of dollars, but it requires preparation and strategy. Remember, everything is negotiable.</p>
            
            <h3>Before You Go to the Dealer</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Get pre-approved for financing:</strong> Know your interest rate and monthly payment</li>
                <li><strong>Research fair market value:</strong> Know what the car is actually worth</li>
                <li><strong>Check for incentives:</strong> Manufacturer rebates and special offers</li>
                <li><strong>Set your maximum budget:</strong> And stick to it</li>
                <li><strong>Consider timing:</strong> End of month, quarter, or model year for better deals</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Negotiation Tips</h3>
            
            <h4>1. Negotiate the Price First</h4>
            <p>Focus on the total purchase price before discussing trade-ins, financing, or add-ons. This prevents dealers from manipulating numbers across different aspects of the deal.</p>
            
            <h4>2. Use Your Research</h4>
            <p>Present your research on fair market value and be prepared to walk away if the dealer won't meet your reasonable offer.</p>
            
            <h4>3. Consider the Total Deal</h4>
            <p>Sometimes a higher purchase price with better financing or a higher trade-in value results in a better overall deal.</p>
            
            <h4>4. Be Prepared to Walk Away</h4>
            <p>This is your most powerful negotiating tool. If you're not getting a fair deal, be willing to leave and shop elsewhere.</p>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>What NOT to Say</h4>
                <p>Avoid telling the dealer: your maximum budget, that you need a car immediately, that you love a specific car, or that you haven't shopped around. These statements weaken your negotiating position.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Common Dealer Add-Ons to Avoid</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Extended warranties:</strong> Often overpriced and unnecessary</li>
                <li><strong>Paint protection:</strong> You can get better protection elsewhere for less</li>
                <li><strong>Fabric protection:</strong> Usually not worth the cost</li>
                <li><strong>Gap insurance:</strong> Check if your regular insurance already covers this</li>
                <li><strong>Dealer prep fees:</strong> Should be included in the advertised price</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="content-card">
            <h2>Step 6: Final Inspection and Paperwork</h2>
            
            <p>Before signing anything, thoroughly inspect the vehicle and carefully review all paperwork. This is your last chance to catch any issues.</p>
            
            <h3>Final Vehicle Inspection</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Exterior:</strong> Check for dents, scratches, rust, or paint issues</li>
                <li><strong>Interior:</strong> Test all electronics, seats, and controls</li>
                <li><strong>Engine:</strong> Look for leaks, unusual noises, or warning lights</li>
                <li><strong>Test drive:</strong> Drive in various conditions (city, highway, parking)</li>
                <li><strong>Tires:</strong> Check tread depth and even wear patterns</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Paperwork Review</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Purchase agreement:</strong> Verify all numbers match your negotiated deal</li>
                <li><strong>Financing documents:</strong> Confirm interest rate, term, and monthly payment</li>
                <li><strong>Title and registration:</strong> Ensure proper transfer of ownership</li>
                <li><strong>Insurance:</strong> Have coverage in place before driving off the lot</li>
                <li><strong>Warranty information:</strong> Understand what's covered and for how long</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="warning-box">
                <h4>Take Your Time</h4>
                <p>Don't let anyone pressure you to sign quickly. Read everything carefully and ask questions about anything you don't understand. A reputable dealer will give you time to review all documents.</p>
